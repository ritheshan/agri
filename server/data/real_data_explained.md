To improve the accuracy and real-world applicability of this model, you can replace synthetic data with real datasets:

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

### Ozone Levels
- [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org): Offers air quality data including Oâ‚ƒ.
- [CPCB India](https://cpcb.nic.in/): Central Pollution Control Board for India.

### Crop Yield
- [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/): International crop statistics.
- [ICAR India](https://icar.org.in/): Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

### Weather & Soil Moisture
- [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com): Public weather API (used in this app).
- [IMD](https://mausam.imd.gov.in): Indian Meteorological Department.
- [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/): Long-term weather and soil datasets.

## ðŸ”„ How to Use
1. Collect CSVs or datasets from the above sources.
2. Clean and join datasets using common keys (e.g., year, region, coordinates).
3. Replace `generate_data()` with loading logic for real data.

```python
import pandas as pd
real_data = pd.read_csv("real_dataset.csv")
X = real_data[["ozone", "temp", "rain", "soil"]]
y = real_data["yield"]
```

4. Retrain the model using `model_training.py` with real data.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip
- Normalize or scale data if using models like neural nets.
- Ensure all features are in compatible units (e.g., temperature in Â°C, ozone in ppb).
- Use average values for locations if point-wise data isnâ€™t available.

## ðŸ“ˆ Bonus
- You can also integrate time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) for yield trends.
- Use historical ozone and climate trends to study long-term impact.
