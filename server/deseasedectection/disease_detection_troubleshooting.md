# Plant Disease Detection - Troubleshooting Guide

## Summary of Issues Fixed

1. **Class Indices Handling**
   - Fixed the mapping between integer and string keys in the class indices
   - Ensured consistent approach between web app and Streamlit app
   - Added robust error handling for missing class indices

2. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Made image preprocessing identical to the Streamlit app
   - Added detailed logging of image shapes and values
   - Ensured proper normalization (division by 255.0)

3. **Cross-Plant Disease Detection**
   - Added special handling for similar diseases across different plants (e.g., Potato vs Tomato late blight)
   - Implemented a similarity detection function to handle common misclassifications
   - Added confidence comparison for similar diseases

4. **Error Handling and Debugging**
   - Added robust error logging throughout the detection pipeline
   - Created detailed console output for diagnosis
   - Added fallback detection with graceful degradation

5. **Testing Tools**
   - Added a dedicated testing script to verify model loading and predictions
   - Created a debug endpoint to test with known sample images
   - Implemented a model reload endpoint for runtime diagnostics

## When Testing Disease Detection

1. Use the `/test_disease_detection` endpoint to verify model operation with known good images
2. If needed, use the `/reload_disease_model` endpoint to force reload the model
3. For direct testing, use the `test_model.py` script in the deseasedectection folder

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Model Loading Issues**
   - Check that the model file exists at the expected location
   - Ensure TensorFlow is properly installed and compatible
   - Verify model input shape matches preprocessed images

2. **Classification Issues**
   - Verify class indices match the model's expected outputs
   - Check if the model is confusing similar diseases across plants
   - Ensure proper image preprocessing (RGB conversion, resizing, normalization)

3. **Low Confidence Issues**
   - Check image quality and lighting
   - Use test images from the dataset to verify proper operation
   - Consider using ensemble methods for ambiguous cases
